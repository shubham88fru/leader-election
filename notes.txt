Zookeeper
---------
- A high performance coordination service. Used by many popular projects like
Kafka, Hadoop, HBase etc. It is a distributed system itself.
- Zookeeper's data model - a tree structure of sorts, where each node is called
a Znode.
- Znodes are a hybrid between File and directory. Two types: Persistent and Ephemeral.
- Persistent znodes are persisted even if the creating service disconnects from zookeeper and joins later.
- Ephemeral znodes are destroyed as soon as the creating service leaves the zookeeper cluster.

-------------------------
leader election algorithm
-------------------------
- Each joining node will submit its' candidacy to be the leader as soon as it joins the zookeeper by
creating a znode under a `/election` znode. Zookeeper is capable of guaranteeing a increasing sequence number
to the creating znodes as each joining service creates them. The service that creates the znode with the smallest
sequence number will declare itself as the leader.
